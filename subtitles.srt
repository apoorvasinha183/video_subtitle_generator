Rick wants to hire me. He said a new studio. Where is it?

90
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,420
the

91
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,240
India

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't remember what year. There's no year. How do you know there's a year for that?

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I think they say the 14th century. But the 14th century was recently.

94
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,940
There

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No, but...

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
No, but I don't know.

97
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's when the moguls are rolling,

98
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,400
what

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Bower wasn't in there.

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
A11, then.

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's definitely BC.

102
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Oh

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's BC for sure.

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
for sure and I think it's Ayodhya.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,500
I was born.

106
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,500
I was born.

107
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
I know that because it raised that temple.

108
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
They said the drum was born there.

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And they don't believe, but that's what they say.

110
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
I don't believe.

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And Ayodhya is in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's right there.

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Therefore the story has to be true.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's probably based on Israel.

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:48,040
as real as event as the Bible is based on one of the whole story or because Rams for the

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,800
had four wives. Three wives. Three wives. Four sons. Four sons. Three wives. Okay. I know the name

117
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
God wasimmering and having no talent on time.

118
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,000
is the sons by the way. Causcellia. Yeah. No. That was the way.

119
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That was the way for the experiment.

120
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So we actually have to try and kick it.

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And... And Koshalea Sun was wrong.

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,500
So, with Rastan was Lachman, Kk's son was Barat, so impressed.

123
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,000
And Shaturvan I think was Lachman's brother, which means he had to...

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,600
is he had to be so bitrassan.

125
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,320
Sita was Ram's wife, right?

126
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,280
And Sita, I know also, came,

127
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,040
Sita's father was Janak.

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,360
was Jannuk. He sees as many names. He's only being wonderful.

129
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,800
Yeah.

130
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,840
Jannuk, Jannuk, he also.

131
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,000
Dammit, he also.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,880
And Vahesh, Vahesh, uh...

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,200
I saw a very, huh?

134
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,400
Where the, where the, where the, I saw a play called where the, right?

135
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,200
Which I learned was another name for Sita.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,600
Ram was about to be crowned by Dashrat as the king and

137
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Ram was about to be...

138
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,200
KKK went to him and because she had got this

139
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,000
Because she had done something really good. I think she had taken

140
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I think she had taken care of him when he was really sick or something like that.

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And so at that point he has said to her that you have one bone and you ask of me I will do.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,120
of me I will do. So she went and asked him to send Ram away for 14 years thinking there

143
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,280
was a long enough time. And if you go away for 14 years, you're pretty much out of

144
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:19,000
out of sight of the mind.

145
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,760
sight out of mind.

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Rajma My son, today I wish to crown you King of Ayyothya, but my evil scheming wife kaika.

147
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Just reminded me of an ancient vow I made.

148
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
To honor this vow, instead of crowning you king,

149
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I must banish you to the forest.

150
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
to the forest for 14 years.

151
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Good bye dear boy.

152
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You are noble and good.

153
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The embodiment of right.

154
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The bodyment of righteousness,

155
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
a brave warrior prince,

156
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
joy of heaven and earth,

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
the ideal man,

158
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
made a God's be with you.

159
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out.

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's what she asked for and the shirt was hot broken but he...

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He died with a given that all Indian men are true to their word.

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He had to do that.

163
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He died eventually.

164
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
He died eventually.

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
He died eventually.

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He died right now.

167
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,500
There's this big scene very drama dramatic he's having a heart attack when his son is going away.

168
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,000
I just assume he died.

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't think he's unaware.

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I do think he's something happens very close.

171
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,800
because he also has a huge issue right?

172
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
He's like ravaged by guilt,

173
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,400
because Ram was with some.

174
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,560
And Ram then was told to go away.

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:11:01,540
Abta..]

176
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,400
Actually said he...

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,360
And did you say if you go?

178
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,000
I go.

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,400
harass our wise men and the desiccrate their ritual fires. I must fight them.

180
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Alone.

181
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,000
But Rama.

182
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But Rama, a woman's place is next to her husband.

183
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I will accept any hardship.

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I cannot live without you.

185
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I cannot live without you.

186
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I cannot live without you.

187
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I hate to think what might have been if we had never met, why should I?

188
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Why should I suppose that this could be?

189
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The weary days are lonely nights are easy.

190
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Are easy to forget

191
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Since I'm here and you are here with me

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You did well, you and I

193
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Let the world

194
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh, Harry Bye!

195
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Even while I waited,

196
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm how they're on.

197
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
There are new

198
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You're the one that made

199
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
I find new

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Here we are

201
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I long together

202
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What matter

203
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Whatever

204
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
We're the way we wandered for

205
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And though we haven't got a bank call

206
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We can still be thankful that here, that here we are.

207
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,460
Ooh, where are we right?

208
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,720
We're here we are.

209
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You never will, you're terrible.

210
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,640
It's winter!

211
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,020
Every y'all

212
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Even the more I wait.

213
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I waited some hard day on you

214
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You'd find me

215
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Not enough

216
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Not my new

217
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
Yeah, we are

218
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
I long together

219
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,620
what matter

220
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,120
So

221
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,400
when it's pouring

222
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,960
that's all

223
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:43,000
On this you. It's only a-

224
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:42,900
thoughts

225
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's only a six-month contract. I'll be back before you know it.

226
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh, my god.

227
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Oh, my god.

228
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Oh, my god.

229
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Oh, my god.

230
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Shamanah was the evil king of Lanka and he just stole.

231
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
stole Sita.

232
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,500
But he was an incredibly loaded man.

233
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,000
For what I understand, Robyn, I was actually the only bad thing he seems to have done.

234
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
He's captured Sita.

235
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I couldn't have seen it.

236
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,400
I can't see them, which is kind of interesting because

237
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,800
Like everything else about him seems to be like he's the silly learned guy. He's knows all these weapons he plays to the right god, I guess

238
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,020
God, I guess. So all the stuff he's like this good king

239
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,800
Except that over time we've been let to believe more and more that he's this complete

240
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Like he's like Mugambo

241
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That's what he lived in Ireland also.

242
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
He lived in Ireland.

243
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah.

244
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He was a devoted Shiva.

245
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah.

246
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Shiva Bhaktan, he plays.

247
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Herr 이윤 ist ein Käieurs.

248
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,080
PlayStation.

249
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,600
There's this whole thing about how devoted the fan he was.

250
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,060
Zeige Sie sehen.

251
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,560
And he's asking Lord Shiva for some wish.

252
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
Je trouve sie etwas ausgeschoben.

253
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,200
And you know, he is...

254
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,800
He is basically playing Vena with his interest so

255
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,320
Okay.

256
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,140
Klar.

257
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,900
It might be hard to felt on a battle because at this point what is pain to a man?

258
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,000
Kompel mit der anderen europäische62

259
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
There's the B9's interesting, there's nothing much.

260
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What I'm really impressed is that he was a king of shulankar.

261
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What I was a king of lankar.

262
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Huge lankar.

263
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Well, some people were doing it.

264
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's the same country, I think.

265
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Well, the point is that's what we think.

266
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
They build a bridge.

267
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
They've bred just still exists so NASA images say.

268
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Really?

269
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That's all.

270
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It must be true then.

271
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's really a story when you're in the moon.

272
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,880
என்ன செல்லவேன் இருந்த மாணக்கியர்.

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
..and you are going to be a great artist.

275
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
..and you are going to be a great artist.

276
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Ravana, Rama has slaughtered your practices in the forest.

277
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You must take revenge.

278
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Don't do..

279
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Don't do it, Master.

280
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Rama is powerful.

281
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Sister, do not bother me with your petty concerns.

282
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
concerns.

283
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Dear brother, Lavina. Have you seen Rama's wife, Sita?

284
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
She is the most beautiful woman.

285
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,200
beautiful woman in the world. Her skin is fair like the lotus blossom. Her eyes are like lotus

286
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,000
boots. Her hat.

287
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,760
Her hands are like, come.

288
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:34,000
Youtuces, her breasts like big round for juicy motors.

289
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What is this?

290
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Make Cita your wife, Bravna. Still her from Rama.

291
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Don't do it, ma'am.

292
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
All here know arguments from you, Maricha.

293
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You must help me at once.

294
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Transform yourself into a beautiful golden deer to distract Rama.

295
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
While Seetha is unguarded, I'll...

296
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll grab her.

297
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
See, tau will be mine.

298
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What a beautiful golden deer!

299
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh Rama, won't you capture it for me?

300
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I don't know, sir.

301
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,900
I don't know Sita, it could be a trick.

302
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,400
Oh Rama please!

303
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,300
All right Sita, you ask for so little and give me...

304
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and give me so much, but promise you won't leave the hut while I'm gone.

305
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The forest is dangerous.

306
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I promise.

307
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh Rama, I love you.

308
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I love you.

309
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I love you.

310
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
See you.

311
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

312

313
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Love was blind to me, now it can't do me, love has opened my eyes.

314
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Then it came to me.

315
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,920
Because it came to me, it's like the game to me

316
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,920
Wherever we have the pride

317
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,160
I never knew how good it is

318
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So how good it was to be

319
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But life to one who means the world to me

320
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I love that

321
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,740
I love that man from the start

322
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,240
And we're down deep in his heart

323
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,300
I know he loves me

324
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,800
Heaven knows why

325
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And when he tells me, can't live with all he makes what would not do for that man.

326
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:16,000
that man. He's not a name Joe of things and what's the odds of the aim? With all his fall from no.

327
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,200
I know he'll get by

328
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,760
I'll be so true to him

329
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,760
He'll never do me

330
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,960
What would I?

331
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But would not do all that man

332
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh when he left

333
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Me lean my, my weary head on his

334
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
on his shoulder.

335
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I close my eyes, right there and wish I never.

336
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I never grow old, I'll never leave him alone, I'll make you trouble.

337
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I love that man who's nobody can

338
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm just no good when his arms are open

339
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,240
Don't go overboard me

340
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,100
What would not do for that man?

341
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,100
Oh, what would not do?

342
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And I do for that man.

343
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I never leave him alone.

344
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'll make you troubled my own.

345
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I love that man better than I do myself

346
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm just no good when he's on the road

347
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What would I do for that man?

348
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
All there's not a thing I wouldn't do.

349
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Do you want my mind?

350
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
I don't know.

351
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But you know what Cita does then?

352
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,440
But you know what?

353
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
How she actually is able to tell these people where she drops her jewelry along the way, right?

354
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And that's what they were able to find.

355
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,840
they were able to find it, which went all the way up to Lanka.

356
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,000
How many times did she drop the Javanese?

357
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
She had the very advantage during the first.

358
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,800
She loved her.

359
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
She left.

360
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,200
I mean, no, she remembers she's not wearing any jewelry

361
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,400
because she left everything before she left.

362
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,600
Ayodhya and she came.

363
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,400
She left everything.

364
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
Yeah, she did.

365
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,480
But she just came in her son-ya's reclurts.

366
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
She just came and her.

367
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,080
Don't challenge these stories.

368
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,120
She's gone.

369
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,400
I told her not to leave the hut.

370
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,240
I told her not...

371
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,500
Oh how will I ever find her?

372
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,000
See you later!

373
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,300
the

374
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
All these demons were attacking the earth and supposedly all the gods

375
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
They weren't meant to wish no and said that please help us please help us.

376
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So wish to said that he was going to be

377
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,320
wish to said that he was going to be born on earth as round, but he was born as Krishna also

378
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,000
this is very confusing now. Just us of the ten ten incarnations. So the tenth one of us the last one.

379
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,320
10th one of us the last one.

380
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,000
Not coming yet supposedly.

381
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So anyway, he said that what we'll do is Shiva will be born as someone who helps.

382
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,200
as someone who helps me, so Shiva was actually

383
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,800
one of one of the incarnations of Shiva.

384
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,000
Why didn't know that?

385
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,200
I didn't know that either.

386
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,400
And so, Hanuman was actually born with the...

387
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,880
And no one would actually bond with the soul purpose or eventually meeting up with Ram

388
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
and helping him.

389
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,680
That was the reason for his butt.

390
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

391
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I will help you. Who are you? I am Haruman, La Bankia Warya, Sun, Naksana.

392
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I am Ramam, the Prince of Ayodhya, the Espialis, I shall be your servant forever.

393
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Ouch!

394
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,940
Now go fine- Proof!

395
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm going to do a lot of things.

396
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm going to do a lot of things.

397
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm going to do a lot of things.

398
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm going to do a lot of things.

399
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm going to do a lot of things.

400
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm going to do a lot of things.

401
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm going to do a lot of things.

402
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm going to do a lot of things.

403
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm going to do a lot of things.

404
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm going to do a lot of things.

405
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm going to do a lot of things.

406
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm going to do a lot of things.

407
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'm going to do a lot of things.

408
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm going to do a lot of things.

409
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Hello?

410
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It's me.

411
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Dave, where are you?

412
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Travandrum, silly.

413
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
silly at home.

414
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You have a home phone?

415
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Of course.

416
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
You've been gone a month and you never emailed me your phone number.

417
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I didn't.

418
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Well, I have some good news.

419
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
They've extended my contract another year!

420
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
What?

421
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Another year?

422
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You said you'd be back in six months.

423
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:20,000
6 months. But I like you here. What about me? What about Lexi? What about our apartment?

424
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
What about us?

425
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,680
Don't cry, Nina.

426
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I love you.

427
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,680
I love...

428
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,460
You could come here.

429
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,960
She sits under a tree and she'll be...

430
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
and she weeps and all the things of her humble and prays to her mom and all the evil people

431
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
you know all these movies and all these shows we've seen and all these

432
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,240
we've seen and all these evil people come and sort of scare her and she plays to Ram.

433
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,000
But I think the thing is that the women demon, whatever.

434
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,480
women demon whatever was a protected our amazed by her devotion, devotion to Ram.

435
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,000
And so, Ram will also come and says, what can Ram do for you, blah blah blah blah.

436
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I don't know if I can come to you, blah blah blah.

437
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
That I can't.

438
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
But she's still in the realm of the world.

439
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You still have one last chance, because once he comes here,

440
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
you know, your ass is grass.

441
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
This is grass.

442
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,560
I love you, Sita.

443
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,680
You must be my wife.

444
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,680
Never.

445
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,000
I love only-

446
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I love only Rama.

447
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,080
I am the chased and virtuous wife of another man.

448
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,040
I belong to Rama as the rays belong to the sun.

449
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,240
Give me back to Rama or you shall soon hear.

450
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,240
..or you should soon hear his mighty bow that resounds like Indra's Thunderbolt.

451
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,720
The more a man speaks, we'll lead to a woman, the more she insults him!

452
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,000
You have two months to decide.

453
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:10,160
months to decide lovely lady. Then you shall share my bed. If you do not marry me, my

454
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
My ruckus ass will slaughter you for my breakfast.

455
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Your ugly yellow eyes are for-

456
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,760
yellow eye should fall out of your head as you stare at me so lustfully, Ravana.

457
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,840
The only reason I do not reduce you to ashes with my own blazing power is because

458
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Is because Rama has not ordered me to do so?

459
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,000
ruff.

460
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Ooooooh!

461
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:55,000
When night is creepin' that I should be sleepin' and bad.

462
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:04,700
And if you're hope that the people who passar them

463
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
My loving dad, I love this baby again

464
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Let it come by, but he forgot to play one

465
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Not after

466
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,340
Not after no one's wrong

467
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,220
That I won't just please come home

468
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,860
That I won't just please come home

469
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
When you're not there, no need to know

470
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
The door is open for you

471
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
We dare

472
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'm not going to be that even I'm not going to take them

473
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
That I won't you please come home

474
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
That I'll do I have the wrong

475
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,200
Everyone has the best message

476
00:28:49,600 --> 00:29:06,660
Some

477
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And have a good trip yet, but I'm lava the week

478
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Daddy, daddy won't you fall home

479
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
아..

480
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,820
You

481
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
아..

482
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
아..

483
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
아..

484
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
아..

485
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm gonna be a little bit more excited.

486
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
아..

487
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm gonna be a little bit more excited.

488
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
아..

489
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm gonna be a little bit more excited.

490
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
아..

491
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm gonna be a little bit more excited.

492
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
아..

493
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm gonna be a little bit more excited.

494
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
아..

495
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
아..

496
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
아..

497
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
아..

498
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
아..

499
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
We've got it even the clock.

500
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Keep taking that I won't you please.

501
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I won't you please come home

502
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
That it is a half-year-old

503
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So very long

504
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Dead life

505
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
perquè

506
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
That is, that I won't you be found home.

507
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
That's all.

508
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
She also made a one-share mistakes.

509
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
In fact, your shirt is gone back with another one.

510
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
The whole idea of my man has to come to save me.

511
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's like, oh, give a one-share tight thing.

512
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,680
a tight thing. Jump on the monkey's back. Go back. She allowed.

513
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,320
Hundreds will be fine, okay. This is possible. She didn't trust the monkey altogether.

514
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,380
It is possible. It is possible that you can't stop the monkey. I think she absolutely trusted the monkey

515
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,320
It is possible.

516
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:03,840
But she wanted her man. Okay, that's something. It's like you got to prove it to me, baby

517
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,840
prove it to me, baby. But not only that, but also wanted.

518
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,960
I'm so happy. But she.

519
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,560
The number she also wanted, the evil king to be defeated.

520
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,720
I think that was the thing that my husband should come and it's actually

521
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,680
It's actually T-shirts, but I don't know.

522
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,040
decent.

523
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,560
I don't you go back so that the evil king doesn't have a hostage and then do it.

524
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,400
But it was almost like she's trying to glorify Ram through this whole...

525
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,160
through this whole process, you know, like like my man will come and he is capable of this and he is

526
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,000
virtuous and he will kill Lavanan.

527
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
So there's a lot of thirsty women.

528
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:19,860
I searched the

529
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
What monkeys?

530
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
They're...

531
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
What I understand is different from monkeys, right?

532
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm there.

533
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Like, what I understand, when I was young, there were monkeys were one kind of one species.

534
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,040
kind of one species and then the one or is actually another species they were half man, half monkey.

535
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,920
Okay because they have tails. Okay but they're they're not like...

536
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Like, yeah.

537
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Yeah, everything's a tail and the...

538
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
They were half... They were half monkey, even more.

539
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Yeah, but that's what the army was because otherwise they were these two brothers.

540
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,720
they were these these two brothers they didn't have any other brothers and then all of

541
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,400
Sugrives big army all the rise of the one or the one or sin the one or sin

542
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,600
right

543
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
Hanuman

544
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,880
Numan, assemble the monkey warriors.

545
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,760
We shall cross the sea to Lanka and rescue Fita.

546
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,440
Yes, my Lord.

547
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,240
We march, act one.

thanks.

549
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm going to be a little bit more fun.

550
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm going to be a little bit more fun.

551
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I'm going to be a little bit more fun.

552
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm going to be a little bit more fun.

553
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I'm going to be a little bit more fun.

554
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
We've had nothing to stand outside, come on in here.

555
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I just had a sore feeling this morning.

556
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

557
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,500
I just know it's good luck coming out way

558
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,000
Good mood

559
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Relueration can't be

560
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Someone coming back to...

561
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Come on back in there.

562
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
We should ask knocking at my door.

563
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I've been waiting also long.

564
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm just dying, everyone.

565
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,400
I have a wrong room, I'm knocking at my door

566
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,440
I know it can't be the mailman, the home and the iceman

567
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,800
They've been here today

568
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Today, every road to the butcher's the baker's, they don't know that way.

569
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
If my sweet is there, I'd die, my arms and heart grow then wide.

570
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,800
If Robin died

571
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,520
Now again, our mortal

572
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:16,980
Fuck

573
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,760

574

583
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I'm ready.

584
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm not gonna have my door.

585
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm ready to come.

586
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm like all the millions of dollars.

587
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,560
And that's it!

588
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,140
Grab something at my door

589
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,640
I know, it's around me!

590
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,420
The milkman hurts my threatened

591
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,600
But it'll hold it

592
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,660
I found it

593
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,400
I hope that it isn't that, I thought I had a man who arrived all the time

594
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,280
If it might be used to be gone, the life you have in

595
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,500
We can age

596
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Woo!

597
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
That's not gonna add my doll.

598
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,380
The sheep...

599
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,520
Oh!

600
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,260
Oh yeah, see you later.

601
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I hope that it is the doctor that is making you my ill

602
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,060
They won't die!

603
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You've been someone that I know

604
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Gonna make him feel I don't say

606
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,440
By realizing that now is my goal

607
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,500
That's it

No kissing in public.

624

Let me take your bag.

625
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,420
Oh

626
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:02,800
Well, here you are.

627
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Good night.

628
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Oh gosh.

629
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Later I know what he did. What did he do when he saw her in the bunker?

630
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
How the hern kiss her?

631
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
No I don't know.

632
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
No, I don't think so. She was very cold.

633
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Why was he cold to see the?

634
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I should have known to be honest with you. I'm very shaky on this point. I don't know what he actually is.

635
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I don't know what he actually can make it up.

636
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You have lived in a...

637
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,640
You have lived in another man's house, so you are unfit to be my wife.

638
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,840
What?

639
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,400
I have done my duty in rescuing you from the enemy and avenging the inf...

640
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,720
and avenging the insult to myself.

641
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,400
I have derabled suspicions about your character and conduct.

642
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,480
A ravana was aware of your beauty.

643
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,240
He cannot have kept you in his help.

644
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,680
have kept you in his house for so long without touching you. The very sight of you is painful.

645
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,080
You are free to go wherever you want. I have no more use.

646
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,760
I have no more use for you, Sita.

647
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,680
If I had known this, I would have killed myself before and spared you this war.

648
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Billed me a funeral fire. I cannot bear to live.

649
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,680
Bill?

650
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Despite my virtues, my husband has rejected me.

651
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
He's obviously doubting her.

652
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I find the whole Piorness thing really odd.

653
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,560
I find it really weird that nobody is commanding Ravan for not

654
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,440
for not forcibly.

655
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,680
elleration..

656
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,800
I know we shouldn't come to you.

657
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,680
Nobody call that.

658
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,400
What are we here here for?

659
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,320
Yeah, but in terms of villains, right?

660
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:24,800
Yeah.

661
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,880
I mean, we expect villains to be villainous.

662
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,600
Yes.

663
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,500
Yes.

664
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,540
This is a guy that's like, if you don't come to me willingly,

665
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,400
This is like...

666
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:34,660
I feel like that myself?

667
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,540
I will not touch you.

668
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,040
Right.

669
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,500
I will not force you in my house.

670
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:33,840
Right.

671
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,380
I will not force myself on you.

672
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,980
But he never had sex with her today.

673
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,160
Saya tidak sel时间.

00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:45,460
Ok, try it on anonymous server.

675
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,040
Kalau kamu payah di cara itu,

676
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,360
kami akan dimincurar othersnya.

677
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Well I'm a bit lonely

678
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,960
Why am I too veuxous with me

679
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,000
But you hate me too

680
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,680
You're myvolvency milk

681
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
You see me crying

682
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I don't know what I'd say home

683
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Each night when you say your home

684
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You don't get on left alone

685
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
You're taking the bruises outside

686
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
You treat me coldly

687
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,440
You're a fucker, you say what you mean to me

688
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
but I'm afraid you don't care for me

689
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
you never show it, don't let me know it

690
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
everyone's that I'm a fool to be

691
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Why am I doing me in you may?

692
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Why do you hate things to me?

693
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You're lovely, may cry.

694
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
me crying please tell me what I say at home

695
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
each night when you say you're fine

696
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
The dumplings that I'm left alone just singin' a blues on time

697
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Feelin' to read me call

698
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
will do you obstruct your

699
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,840
Because love is called, need

700
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,220
when I was home

701
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Somebody is near near, at my feet

702
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Great fun for you

703
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Can't you see what you're doing to me please

704
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:52,000
You'll need to tell me why I'm the only one who made you win

705
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
That's y'all

706
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And he still not convinced seemed like after she went through the trial by fire.

707
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I mean it's almost like...

708
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
No, I thought he was convinced.

709
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,360
He was convinced. He then was pure pressure later with the washroom.

710
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah, because he was convinced. He was not even doubted.

711
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,160
He was like, okay, you all pure.

712
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,160
And I think he did hug her and then flop.

713
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
and then flowers fell from the heavens or something.

714
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Whoops, I guess you were pure after all.

715
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Will you forgive me, Sita?

716
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Of course Rama, I leave only for you.

717
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Hey, they want me to attend this meeting so much, they're gonna fly me all the way to New York.

718
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,880
Why me all the way to New York?

719
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,600
Five days all expenses paid.

720
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,320
That's great.

721
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,680
It'll be fun for you.

722
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
See you next week.

723
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:25,000
No, no, no, no, the flying chariot's on the gods sent to chariot.

724
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,060
center chair yet. I don't know something about

725
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,020
I'm a strange. I'm finding it. I'm fine. I found it to be totally cool.

726
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:33,020
Newsec the world's first airplane or something. Newsec the first

727
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,560
Like that's actually flew by her. I was on the on a bird was there a bird?

728
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,020
actually.

729
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,200
I think was actually a flying thing or something called a

730
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,920
There was a carpet like a lot of them no no it's like a ill

731
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,680
No, no, it was like a elaborate structure.

732
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,960
And that's what he came back on.

733
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,640
The flanked.

734
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,280
Pushpaka Vimana.

735
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,640
That was one of the air-ended jumbo jets also.

736
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,240
And there's a movie, a sign.

737
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,640
There's a movie, a silent movie.

738
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,640
That was.

739
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,440
But that's what I mean.

740
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,840
It was like this thing.

741
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,840
It wasn't a bird ever.

742
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,840
The way it was.

743
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,840
Right.

744
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,240
I guess what is happening.

745
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I guess what is happening the 14 years were finishing off so they had to find a quick way to get back.

746
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:28,000
What does it matter if rain comes your way?

747
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,400
her way and rain dropped at all noon

748
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,680
The rain, the evening took a lot of makeover

749
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm happy ending is waiting for you

750
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000

751
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Um

752
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
You're not a man.

753
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
You're not a rainbow.

754
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
You're not a brave man.

755
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
What if you're lost?

756
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
What if your love of bad should break up?

757
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Have they sometimes will?

758
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000

759
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,740

760
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:43,580
Bad huh I'm bad

761
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,560
The shower that I know may be

762
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,280
If you want the rainbow

763
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,280
You must have the right

764
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:48,380

765
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,000
If you want the rainbow then you might have a rain

766
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
For yourself to gather

767
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
with a happy train.

768
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:07,000
If you want the rainbow, then you have a rainbow.

769
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
So with your lucky star, is that you?

770
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000

Because you have the world to gain

774
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
If you want the rainbow, why you're just more

775

842
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I'm going to go to the beach

843
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I'm going to go to the beach

844
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I'm going to go to the beach

845
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I'm going to go to the beach

846
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I'm going to go to the beach

847
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

848
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
너만마

849
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,600
INC ourselves.

850
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,600
strike 2007.

851
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I'm pregnant.

852
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
That's wonderful darling.

853
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Maybe they join the Milite Club.

854
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
That's the push for the Marlos.

855
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
We don't know that.

856
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,040
We don't know exactly when she got very soon thereafter, which is why it's conceivable that someone could argue that love that

857
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,860
She wasn't pregnant because of wrong, but I think it was wrong plus

858
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Plast with me, it is wrong.

859
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,280
I'm not like Rama.

860
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,920
Kool tea kemuma is slept in another man's house.

861
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,920
Look at that happens with a dough beat.

862
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
That happens at Toby.

863
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
There's a Toby story.

864
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Yeah.

865
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
No, the Toby, the one that's that.

866
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And one, the Toby's wife is with somebody else.

867
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
She comes back.

868
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
the air. When she comes back, he goes, what do you think I'm wrong?

869
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I'm like grandma.

870
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
To take somebody back right now.

871
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I was obviously been in the lobby as I was in the washroom and I was watching.

872
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And when the law gets wrong, Ram says, I cannot do it.

873
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,300
says, I cannot rule, I cannot rule.

874
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,820
You might subjects don't respect me.

875
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:52,320
Right.

876
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,800
And so you'll have to, actually, that's when he banishes me.

877
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,520
Sorry.

878
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,280
That's when he banishes me.

879
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,280
That's right.

880
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Uh, say, Sita, would you like to take a trip?

881
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,500
But we just got here.

882
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,000
Yeah, great, get packing.

883
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Get back in.

884
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:14,520
Brother Laksman, my wife's dubious reputation casts doubt upon my own.

885
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,200
You must drive see the...

886
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
You must drive Cedar to the forest and abandon her there.

887
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I cannot have her in my kingdom.

888
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I think basically as a king he had to sort of do if the...

889
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,400
If the common man was doing that to their wife,

890
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,200
then why would the king treat his wife any differently?

891
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,200
I felt he let her go, not because he thought she was impure,

892
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,200
but because he said...

893
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,120
because he said that to be a king he's a respect of his subjects and he can't be considered well

894
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:42,600
I don't think he'll have a go-to issue. I felt that he always had this element of doubt. I mean it

895
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I mean, it coupled with, of course, his words show that everybody spoke off and that he kept his word to his dad and then his subjects is king.

896
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,680
his kingdom, but I felt like he always had this shout that she might not be pure.

897
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I feel too bad.

898
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I'm feeling my mistake and soul

899
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
So bad, I feel

900
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:33,540
so

901
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:39,040
if

902
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I'm worrying about going through down and...

903
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:51,400
I'm worried about Fennu, I'm afraid

904
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,900
I'm man, I'm gonna leave

905
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:13,960
music

906
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,380
So it means I can't be

907
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:09,880
We're the color of my knees

908
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,960
The color of my life means

909
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,300
That's me!

910
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,760
Jonna's die

911
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,780
It final mad just adds my bad

912
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
If I die well he be

913
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:22,880
Evan dies

914
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
He's the color man

915
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
He's the color woman like me

916
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Don't know any reason why he treats me so far

917
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
What about gone?

918
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,280
...and I've above all gone I'm scared

919
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:48,860
...made my troubles double with his vories when strong as I in the devil

920
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Just living of none

921
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
My name's Lowe

922
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
My sweet man is gonna go

923
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
When he goes out

924
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I was out loud, I think

925
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:06,000
He's a kind of man, he's a kind of woman like me

926
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I'm gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who's gonna be the one who

927
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Don't know any reason why he treats me so poorly

928
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
What about going?

929
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I'm done.

930
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Make my travel travel with his woman when she's all in.

931
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I didn't have enough.

932
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I love no reason

933
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
My man loves

934
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
My sweet man is gonna go

935
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
When he goes

936
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Don't be, be the man

937
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
That needs a woman

938
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Just let me

939
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,800
Say what you deserve

940
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:32,900
If you loved this and I thought you deserved cut 1,000,000,000...

941
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

942
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

943
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

944
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

945
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

946
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

947
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

948
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

949
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

950
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

951
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I must have committed a terrible sin in a previous.

952
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

953
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

954
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

955
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

956
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,600
I will send an e-predious life to deserve such suffering,

957
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,400
where I not caring Rama's son,

958
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,600
I would throw myself into the river.

959
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:37,000
She's always shown to be pregnant in after what she's become.

960
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
After, no, when she's banished and she's gone into the forest again.

961
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,200
the first again and you know there she meets that teacher.

962
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,960
So that's how Varmic wrote the Ramayana because she's a totally story to him.

963
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:07,000
I'm got the woman.

964
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,520
I'm just a woman, a lonely woman, way,

965
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,000
not a weary shawl.

966
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I'm just a woman, but only you.

967
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
But only if you move one you should be sorry for

968
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Got up this morning, how long about done without a...

969
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Without a wall and I found me with domed

970
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
What you're doing, I could do it

971
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Ain't never done it before

972
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,000
People, am I blue?

973
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Am I blue?

974
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Maybe, maybe.

975
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Baby, can't believe I'm telling you

976
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
How my blue

977
01:02:51,000 --> 01:03:01,000
You'd be good, you'd be fine with your man, don't you?

978
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And then they're ruined

979
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And then they're ruined

980
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
And then they're ruined

981
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:19,000
But now I'm not that I'm lonely one

982
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I'm gonna go to the next one.

983
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
One, two, one.

984
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
One, two, one.

985
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
One, two, one.

986
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
One, two, one.

987
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:33,740
My dream is to come well, dream, dream of suitable

988
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,060

989
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,920
4, Iceland

990
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:45,900
You're no longer on a run while to be a big holiday

991
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I love you

992
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
No one feels like I do

993
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:02,760
Um

994
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
To the temple

995
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:07,760
deserted town

996
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,600
the walls in the land

997
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:13,360
the walls in the eyes

998
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Only one but now I'm

01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000

1000
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Love one

1001
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
What I get, oh Lord, what I get

Damn, I'm what I want, yeah you go

1003
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,820
I believe I believe we are born and we are human.

1004
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,860
Sial!

1005
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,880
Only goon Dohsan!

1006
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,000
7 Kushewah, or La Waim Kushewah, want to see the forest.

1007
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And we actually taught by Waimiki, who taught them how to sing on these songs.

1008
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:04,120
songs raising around

1009
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Love, who's?

1010
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Let us sing the praises of love.

1011
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Brahma's great!

1012
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:25,000
is great. Drama is good. Drama is just right. Drama is a guiding light.

1013
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
We're waiting like perfect math, perfect sign

1014
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Robbers love by everyone, always like never off

1015
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
We praise well

1016
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,600
We praise love, I'm in the song

1017
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,400
We praise love, we praise praise

1018
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,000
We're all my selfies, life of grace

1019
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
It's like a role in the...

1020
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
You can wear nails, you can sew,

1021
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Don't mind the slides,

1022
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Don't mind the shots,

01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000

01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Don't mind the slides,

1031
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Mama's raped, Mama's good

01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Don't mind the slides,

1033
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000

Don't mind the slides,

1042
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Don't mind the slides,

01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Don't mind the slides,

01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Don't mind the slides,

1047
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:15,720
Perfect sun, Ramas of Viya, everyone always right, never wrong

1048
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Don't mind the slides,

1049
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,760
We praise our mark in the song

1050
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:32,160
love.

1051
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I'm going to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one to be the first one

1052
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1053
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Hello?

1054
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Please take me back.

1055
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Please, please, please, please.

1056
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I'll do anything, please.

1057
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Please.

1058
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:13,000
If you're a girlfriend, who has been treated really badly by her ex or by her current boyfriend or whatever, and

1059
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:21,000
and she kept saying, no, every day, I'm gonna make sure I cook for him and send him a hot lunch at noon.

1060
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Aren't you going to run?

1061
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Aren't you going to turn around and be like, listen, he doesn't like you and talk to you. You've got to move on.

1062
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:30,920
Something's wrong. Okay, he does doing this pooch every day. I mean, I've

1063
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:36,400
I mean I feel I feel see I feel what I was just all good good and bad thing that we always want people to be either all good

1064
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,920
All but I think she's also has got her own issues like she didn't go back with her no month

1065
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
She didn't go back with her no more.

1066
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
She could have saved hundreds and thousands of people from in killed.

1067
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Monkey especially.

1068
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Yeah, what about animal rights?

1069
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
And then she blink.

1070
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,600
She prayed for this guy every day.

1071
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,800
Come on.

1072
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,200
But also at that point of time,

1073
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,000
it was just that unconditional love, you know, for her,

1074
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
it was like, okay, I can't.

1075
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,640
I think this is the part of the female perspective that disagree with because it's like

1076
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:06,800
Then we can say oh yeah, because she loved him so she did there you know it's like yeah, but she sure loved someone who doesn't treat her right

1077
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
one who doesn't treat her right.

1078
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
She's so badly.

1079
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Okay, that's her mistake.

1080
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
You

1081
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,040
You wanna weigh our love, you

1082
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:31,439
We broke the ties that bind

1083
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:34,080
I wanted to fall again

1084
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:39,000
To forget you and lay the past behind

1085
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Still the magic of the night I'm out

1086
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:49,000
My room seems to stay forever in my mind

1087
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
But God was blue

1088
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
and high-bomb

1089
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
the moon was new

1090
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
and the moon was loud

1091
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,000
the bigger heart of the moon was sick

1092
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I was singing, mama, what can you be?

1093
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
You came alive to love her.

1094
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I love how it's down

1095
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
You're glad day is past

1096
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
You've gone away

1097
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,000
They're taking all the money I see

1098
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I'm listening, above I'll come back to me when I remember every little thing.

1099
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,500
Every little thing you used to know

1100
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:34,779
I'm so lonely

1101
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:36,979
Every road I walk alone

1102
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I walk and I walk along with you

1103
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,000
No wonder I'm lonely

1104
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:52,000
The sky is blue, the night is cold, the moon is new

1105
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
But the moon is on

1106
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:02,000
And while I'm waiting here, there's horror, my essay.

1107
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Love a gun.

1108
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,440
Lá que vem sobre nós

1109
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:31,000
This guy is blue.

1110
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I is blue, I'm not at cold, I'm a dead new, but I'm not alone, and why I'm...

1111
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:46,000
And while I'm waiting here this hot of mine is dinging

1112
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Love a come by

1113
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Come by, do we?

1114
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
That's all.

1115
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:04,000
And when Ram was in the forest, he heard these two boys singing.

1116
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
He didn't know who they were, but he came up and he was just like...

1117
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,680
came up and he was just like, who are they, who are you? And that's when he finds out that

1118
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:14,000
Tau, Sitas de Andoza his children. My son!

1119
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,400
He turned to Ayodhya Palace to do with me fully turned it.

1120
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,000
But then he was take love and push back.

1121
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Very soon.

1122
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
but he still hasn't no more tingle back.

1123
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Sita, well, yes, of course.

1124
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Sita, all Sita has to do is prove...

1125
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:40,600
is prove her purity again. Another trial by fire perhaps. All we could try trial by water,

1126
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:45,080
you know, see if she sinks or floats.

1127
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:50,640
or floats. If she thinks she's pure. If she floats, no way. If she floats, she's pure. If she

1128
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,000
thinks he has a...

1129
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
and he asked her to prove

1130
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
her purity one more time.

1131
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I think I should know about her.

1132
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
The answer or whatever she says.

1133
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I shall prove my purity to you.

1134
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:10,000
If I have always been true to Rama, if I have never thought of another man, if I am completely pure in body and soul, then...

1135
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,400
Then, May Mother Earth take me back into home.

1136
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:37,000
このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは、このようなアイスは

1137
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I'm flying high, but I gotta be like a fallen, fallen, fallen, oh no.

1138
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Fallin' for nobody else but you

1139
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
You caught my eye and I got a feeling I'm full

1140
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Feeling a fallen, show me the ring and a young bright room

1141
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
I used to travel, think of...

1142
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,600
Think all we can do

1143
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,260
Think all now

1144
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:38,260
Now I'm a thing that I'll all for you

1145
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:39,920
I miss the pulse

1146
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
It's the fall soon stand by

1147
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
For rather of the banana falling

1148
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Fallin' for nobody and but you

1149
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Thank you.

1150
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:25,000
아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아 아, 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아

1151
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Oh honey, oh honey, I never felt this way

1152
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Oh, man, it's me, I'm a...

1153
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I'm up in the air

1154
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:51,600
It's funny, it's so funny me taking it the way

1155
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
But they feel good.

1156
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I'm blind, I'm open, I'm blind.

1157
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,420
But I got a funny feeling that I'm falling

1158
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:07,180
Falling for nobody else by you

1159
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:09,920

1160
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
You caught my eye and baby that glow

1161
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I've got a funny feeling that I'm falling

1162
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Show me the ring and the boy I'll take it from you

A lot of our children

1232
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
With a dog and a man

1233
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:22,000
You and the dog are gone, but the memory may end soon.

1234
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:28,000
The night was made and the melody seemed to say

1235
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Down the world had to wait

1236
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:36,000
way. Take your happiness while you may.

1237
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
And eat the night of the moon.

1238
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:55,000
The moon is beautiful and I found with a break on dawn

1239
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
You and the song had gone

1240
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,620
a backstory

1241
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:04,360

1242
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:07,080

1243
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:12,220

01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:15,460
hundred

1245
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
You are the dog of the dark

1246
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:19,220
hundred

1247
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
But the memory may be the dark

1248
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:20,940
hundred

1249
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:22,480
nine

1250
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
And I will bring

1251
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,220
hundred

1252
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:29,000

01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,960
eight

1254
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Someone will pass away

1255
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Thank you, happiness

1256
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,780

I'll break a bone,

1260
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,000
You'll understand, I'll go.

1261
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:10,000
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A

1262
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,080
ざわたてない僕は

01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,840
な テディ

1264
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
There we go, there we are.

1265
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:38,600
That the hell would have you still say that you guys pushed your soul instead.

1266
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:46,000
So now this place is so green to others.
