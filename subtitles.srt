00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,100
We have a million people here over the country.

19
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

20
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

21
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,260
And then switch it over to the gut!

22
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,380
No!

23
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,220
Sure we can go, but we will be animatic.

24
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

25
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,020
Move up!

26
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

27
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,020
Snack!

28
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,640
Rick wants to hire me.

29
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,760
He said a new studio.

30
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,500
Yeah!

31
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
new studio. Where is it?

32
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,760
vindya!

33
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
imaria

34
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:11,340
If you continue to elemento greater, this part can be a formal effect.

35
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
When?

36
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't remember what you...

37
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
don't remember what he has, there's no, how do you know what they're the year for that?

38
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I think they say the foot.

39
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,600
I think they say the 14th century, but...

40
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,480
The 14th century was recently.

41
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,880
Association of Environmental Experience and Weather Management

42
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
No, but I don't know.

43
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
No, but...

44
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's when the moguls are rolling, Bavaro was an Indian.

45
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,200
Confirmed by Sur два and sub!!

46
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
How it was in India?

47
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
11, then.

48
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's definitely BC.

49
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's B.C. for sure and I think it's a your deal.

50
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,240
...t abonn, jangan!

51
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,160
They said the term was born there.

52
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
And they said, don't believe.

53
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
But that's what they say.

54
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And Ayodhya is in the state of Uttar Padehsh.

55
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
And I owed here.

56
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's right there, therefore.

57
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,280
It's right there, therefore the story has to be true.

58
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,200
It's probably based on as real as event.

59
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
as event as the Bible is based on, you want another whole story?

60
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
or because Rama's father had four legs.

61
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
had four wise three wives three wives four sons

62
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,720
For some three guys. Okay, I know the name of the sons by the way.

63
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Cocellular.

64
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Inscusable spice with pizza salad and that really does not cause you could eat

65
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
beyond wars and

66
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And Kojali Asan was wrong. So with Rasan was left one.

67
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,780
an

68
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,500
Okaylusion was but up so impressed and

69
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,480
... and

70
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and Shaturvan I think was Lakshman's brother which means he had to be

71
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,640
to be so bit rust sun.

72
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,000
See that was Ram's wife, right?

73
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,640
And Sita, I know also, came, Sita's father was Janak.

74
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,400
was Jannak. You see that's many names. You see that only being wonderful. Yeah.

75
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yeah.

76
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah.

77
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I think we can do that.

78
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah.

79
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And Vahist Vahist.

80
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,240
Bravo, d overhe...

81
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,340
very, hı?

82
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,539
Where the he, where the he, I saw play, call where the he, right?

83
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,039
Which I learned was another name for Sita.

84
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and there was another name for CD.

85
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,560
by Dashrat as the king and Kaka went to him and...

86
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,240
because she had got this, because she had done something really good.

87
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
because she...

88
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,040
I think she had taken care of him when he was really...

89
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
care of him when he was really sick or something like that.

90
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes.

91
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And so at that point here.

92
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,800
And so at that point he has said to her that you have one bone and you ask of me I will do.

93
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
of me I will do. So she went and asked him to send Ram away for 14 years.

94
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,040
14 years thinking there was a long enough time and if you go away for 14 years you're pretty much

95
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're pretty much out of sight at a mine.

96
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,960
Rm 1

97
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Rama-Maisan, today I wish to crown you King of Ayodhya.

98
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,920
King of Iotya, but my evil scheming wife kaika.

99
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,240
Just reminded me of an ancient vow I made.

100
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,840
to honor this vow instead of crowning you king I must

101
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,840
I must banish you to the forest for 14 years.

102
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Good bye dear boy.

103
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You are no one and good.

104
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,880
noble and good, the embodiment of righteousness,

105
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,040
a brave warrior.

106
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Brave Warrior Prince, Joy of Heaven and Earth, the I.D.

107
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The ideal man, may the gods be with you.

108
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out.

109
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's what she asked for and that shit was hard broken but he

110
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He's given that all Indian men are true to their word.

111
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,600
Uh, he has to, he has to do that.

112
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,800
And then he died and then he died.

113
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
And then...

114
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,100
I don't think what he died.

115
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
ratı

116
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,100
He died eventually.

117
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,800
Orada Playlazı

118
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm clearly a lot of scene when I was a kid.

119
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He died right now.

120
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
There's this big scene, they're drama.

121
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
seeing they drama dramatic he's having a heart attack when his son is going away.

122
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I should assume he's...

123
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Saya benda itu di campu somewhere.

124
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,240
Ada dianca THERE kelinys...

125
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Ya, seluruh....

126
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah, that's true.

127
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,760
And he also has a huge issue, right?

128
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,760
Is that garbage by guilt?

129
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,200
because Ram was with some. And Ram then he was told to go away. Actually said he was.

130
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,760
Because...

131
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,960
actually said he would like it and create problems you're not gonna say why you just kind of said

132
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,400
Et vous pouvez me nick vous êtes ici.

133
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,300

No, Sita.

137
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,920

Rock Shasa demons.

141

But Rama, a woman's place.

143
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
A woman's place is next to her husband.

144
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I will accept any hardship.

145
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,360

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We had never met, why should I suppose?

153
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000

We were the incredibly loaded man for what I understand.

248
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I just don't admit for what I understand, Robert, I was actually the only bad thing he seems to have done.

249
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
have done is captures it.

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I can absolutely done.

251
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Which is kind of interesting because so...

252
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,040
Because like everything else about him seems to be like he's this really learned guy he's no

253
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
He knows all these weapons he plays to the right guard, Zergas.

257
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,480

Kenapa...!

270
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
But the stone?

271
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:51,880
Yeah.

272
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,680
That's also all in all.

273
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So I did not.

274
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,680
For sure.

275
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah, there's this whole thing about how devoted a fan he was.

276
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
he was and he's asking Lord Shiva for

277
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
for some wish and you know he is basically playing.

278
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,800
basically, playing Vena with his inner side.

279
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It might be hard to felt someone in the battle because at this point what is Spain to a man?

280
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
There's no big noise in this time, there's nothing much.

281
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What I'm really impressed is that he...

282
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
you know that he was a king of shulank up.

283
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,060
all the years of Lanka.

284
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,360

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
It's the same country I think.

286
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Well, the point is that's what we think.

287
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,400
Well the point is that's what...

288
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
They build a bridge.

289
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000

324
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Don't do it, Mas.

325
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Master!

326
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
All here no arguments from you, Maricha.

327
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You must help me at once.

328
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Transform.

329
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Transform yourself into a beautiful golden deer to distract Rama.

330
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Stack Rama.

331
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Wall Seatize and guarded.

332
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'll...

333
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll grab her!

334
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
See, tau will be mine!

335
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
will be mine.

336
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,700
What i think...

337
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What a beautiful golden deer!

338
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,180
What did the ass fucking mean?

339
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Oh Rama!

340
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,880
Oh Rama, won't you capture it for me?

341
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,360
I don't know, Sita. Good.

342
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It could be a trick.

343
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh, Ramak please!

344
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
All right, Sita. You ask for so little and give me...

345
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,800
little and give me so much, but promise you won't leave the hut while I'm gone.

346
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
to while I'm gone. The forest is dangerous.

347
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I promise.

348
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh, Rama, I love you.

349
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I love you.

350
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,940
さて、自宅

351
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は、このようなお前は

352
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Love was blind to me, now it comes.

353
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Now it kind to me love has opened my eyes

354
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I then became to me, slides the game.

355
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
today I took games for how i feel

356
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,500
so addicted I am

357
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I never knew how good it was to be.

358
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It was too big, but left one who means

359
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Who means the world to me?

360
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I love that

361
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I love that man from the start and we're down deep in his heart.

362
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I know he loved me, never knows what

363
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And when he tells me, can't live.

364
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,480
As we can learn the languages

365
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,680
in what we're learning now.

366
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But what would not do for that man?

367
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
He's not...

368
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
He's not a name, Joe of fame, and what the odds of the day

369
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
with all his fault.

370
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I know he'll get my-

371
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You'll get by

372
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'll be so true to him

373
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Him, you never told me what would not.

374
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But would not do all that man

375
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Go when you...

376
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,320
but someone he loves

377
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,560
めly mama horsery

378
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I wear red on his shoulder

379
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I close my eyes, right there.

380
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Right there and wish I never grow old

381
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Oh, done, I'll never leave.

382
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'll never leave him alone, I'll make his trouble my own.

383
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I love that man, nobody can

384
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm just no good when it's on the road.

385
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,740
kalau orang食,swipe your destiny

386
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,500
if your enemy has busy

387
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,000

388
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,140
maybe where does my arrival

389
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And I do all that man, all what would.

390
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,360
if your enemy has busy

391
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,460
if your enemy has busy

392
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,060
if your enemy has busy

393
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What would not do for the man?

394
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,660
if your enemy has busy

395
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,740
if your enemy has busy

396
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,440
that's a good name

397
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,800
you guys gotta keep the night

398
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,620

ㅎ

400
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,760
I don't know where friendship goes...

401
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,920
And

402
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,420
they're just in the shade

403
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,800
and

404
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,020
they're never in aỏi

405
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,800
I'll never leave him alone.

406
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,000
I'll make you troubled my own.

407
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I love that man better than I do my

408
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm just no good when it's on the...

409
00:21:44,000 --> 00:22:07,460
The band is there and the crowd is her

410
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I don't even need you so warm

411
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,160
ed each and everyone

412
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But a lot of things I wouldn't do for my mind

413
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,580
Bye.

414
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,760
acuerdo.

415
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
but you know what Cita does then?

416
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,960
see the dust then how she actually is able to tell these people where she drops her jewelry.

417
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,960
surgery along the way, right? And that's how they were able to find it.

418
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
they were able to find it, which went all the way up to Lanka.

419
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
How many times did she drop the jewelry?

420
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
She had the ring and John was shooting the first.

421
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,740
She was really the first. She loves you.

422
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,240
I mean, no, she remembers she's not wearing any dress.

423
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,340
She's not wearing any jewelry because she left everything before she left.

424
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,700
I know the aunt she came.

425
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,840
and she came.

426
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,700
She left.

427
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,960
She left everything, yeah, she did.

428
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,440
She just came and her son, Yasi clothes.

429
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Don't challenge these stories.

430
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
Don't challenge.

431
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
She's gone.

432
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I told her not to leave the hut.

433
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,280
to leave the hut, oh how will I ever find her?

434
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,640
びたした

435
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,500
Hm...

436
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,680
Energyiero.

437
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:11,960
Actually the origins of eyes are fun of man.

438
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
the all these demons were attacking the earth and supposedly

439
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and supposedly all the God they were in went to Vishnu and said that please help us.

440
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,800
that please help us, please help us.

441
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,200
So wish to said that he was going to be born on earth as round.

442
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
as Ram.

443
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But he was born as Krishna also, this is very confusing though.

444
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That's of that.

445
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
10, 10 in God.

446
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,960
10 in garnish. So the 10th one of us the last one. Not come yet, sir.

447
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
not come yet supposedly. So anyway he said that what we will do.

448
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,040
that what we'll do is Shiva will be born as someone who helps me.

449
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,200
as someone who helps me to Shiva was actually

450
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,800
one of the incarnations of Shiva.

451
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
of Shiva.

452
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Oh, you didn't know that?

453
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I didn't know that either.

454
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And so...

455
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So, honey, I will actually bond with the soul purpose or eventually meet the...

456
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,560
meeting up with Ram and helping him.

457
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,760
That was the reason for his butt.

458
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
for his butt.

459
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I will.

460
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I will help you. Who are you? I am Haru.

461

What?

486
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Another year?

487
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You said you'd be back in six months.

488
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
six months. But I like you here. What about me?

489
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What about Lexi?

499
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,280

502
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
whatever the women demon, whatever.

503
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
But so what's the protector?

504
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Our amazes, by her.

505
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
by her devotion, devotion to Ram.

506
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And so Rabun also comes in says,

507
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,320
We also come in and say, what can Ram do for you, blah blah blah.

508
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
That I can't.

509
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,960
that I can't, but she's still round will come here.

510
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,320
That I can't, but she's...

511
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,080
And you still have one last chance,

512
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
because once he comes, you know, your ass is grass.

513
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,400
because once he comes here.

514
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I love you, Sita. You must...

515
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,480
You must be my wife.

516
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,000
Never. I love only.

517
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I love only Rama.

518
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I am the chased and virtuous wife of another man.

519
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I belong to Rama as the race belong.

520
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,200
the rays belong to the sun.

521
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
Give me back.

522
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Give me back to Rama or use of soon here his mighty bow that resounds like

523
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
that resounds like Indra's Thunderbolt.

524
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,080
Female

525
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
more a man speaks weekly to a woman the more she insults her.

526
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,480
U.S.

527
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You have two months to decide.

528
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
months to decide lovely lady. Then you shall

529
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,960
You shall share my bed if you do not marry me

530
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You do not marry me. My raksha-sas will slaughter you for my.

531
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
you for my breakfast.

532
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Your ugly yellow eyes should fall out of your head as you stare at me so much.

533
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
you stare at me so lustfully, Ravana. The only reason I do not reduce you to...

534
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You not reduce you to ashes with my own blazing power is because Rama has not ordered.

535
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Mama has not ordered me to do so.

536
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아 아, 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
No one can fill our way through the chat.

549
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,920
Are you ready to go now?

550
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,880
That it is a healthy room for very long

562
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:45,200
Follow me

563
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Yeah, who would like to be she?

564
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm tripped yet, but I'm a...

565
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,160
Yeah, but I'm lovable and weak and bad

566
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
That I won't you be down home

567
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
That's all.

568
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
She also made a one-chair mistake, in fact, your chair just gone back with a number.

569
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,600
just go on back with on the one.

570
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,940
The whole idea of my man is to come to save me.

571
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,340
He's like, oh, give it one.

572
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,720
go give one of the tight things. Jump on the monkeys back, go back, chill out.

573
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,820
She allowed hundreds will be fine, okay?

574
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,200
This is possible she didn't trust the monkey all took.

575
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,320
trust the monkey altogether. It is possible, it is possible that you

576
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I think she absolutely trusted the monkey, but she wanted to

577
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
trust the monkey.

578
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,600
But she wanted her man.

579
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,000
Okay, so that's something you're like, you gotta prove it to me, baby.

580
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
But not only that.

581
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,920
$70?

582
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:17,180
情人

583
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Number she also wanted the evil king to be defeated. I think that was the thing that my husband should come and it's actually decent

584
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,480
It's actually decent matter.

585
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,040
I don't you go back so that the evil king doesn't have a hostage.

586
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,600
I was lucky he doesn't have a hostage and then do it.

587
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,580
Ki

588
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,840
大家

589
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,100
But it was almost like she's trying to glorify Ram.

590
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,640
好吧

591
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
glorify Ram through this whole process, you know, like like my man will come and he is.

592
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,600
TB

593
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,340
阿

594
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
and will come and he is capable of this and he is virtuous and he will kick.

595
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:27,500
不過

596
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:27,860
我

597
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,020
我

598
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
and he will kill Ravana.

599
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:31,800
在

600
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Zoom in and see women.

601
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
surely

602
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
monkeys because they actually they're

603
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
What I understand is different from monkeys, right? I'm there.

604
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Like, what I'm...

605
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,760
Like for what I understand, when I was young, there were monkeys were one kind of one species and then

606
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And then the runners, actually, are now the species of a half-man, half-monkey.

607
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Okay.

608
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Okay, because they have tails.

609
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Okay, but they're not like...

610
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,480
Like yeah, yeah, everything the tail and the they will have

611
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
They will have, they will have half monkey, even more.

612
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Yeah, but that's what the army was because otherwise...

613
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,600
Army was because otherwise they were these these two brothers they didn't have any

614
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
arm.

615
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
Two brothers and then all of sucreaves.

616
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,840
He was a big army, all the one are Senna.

617
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
And be...

618
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,040
The one are Senna, right?

619
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
on the scene.

620
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Right.

621
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000

672
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Well, I'm gonna break it.

He doesn't move the ham on theLaLaLa paper

677
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,800
It was really satisfying to practice, for example.

678

Don't make him feel I don't say whoo

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Well...

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Well, here you are. Good night.

701
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Goodnight.

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Oh gosh.

703
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Later I know what he did, what he did.

704
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I know what he did. What he did when he saw her in Lanka.

705
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
How the hernkiss her? No, I don't think so. She was very cold.

706
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
is very cold.

707
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I don't want to be honest with you, I'm very shaky on this point.

708
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I don't know what he actually can make it up.

709
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
make it up.

710
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000

711
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You have lived in a...

712
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,640
You have lived in another man's house, so you are unfit to be my wife.

713
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
What?

714
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I have done my duty in rescuing you from the enemy.

715
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,680
you from the enemy and avenging the insult to myself.

716
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,200
I have derables to spiff.

717
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,360
have derabable suspicions about your character and conduct.

718
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,040
A ravana was aware of your beauty.

719
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,960
aware of your beauty, he cannot escape you in his house for so long without touching you.

720
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Not touching you, the very sight of you is painful.

721
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,640
You are free to go wherever you want. I have no more use for you, Sita.

722
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You are...

723
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
for you, Sita.

724
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
If I had known this, I would have...

725
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I would have killed myself before and spared you this war.

726
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Bill?

727
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,960
Build me a funeral fire. I cannot bear to live this fight my

728
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,620
Despite my virtues, my husband has rejected me.

729
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,220
He's obviously doubt.

730
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,400
He's obviously doubting her pureness.

731
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I find the whole Piorna is think really odd.

732
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
I find him.

733
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I find it really weird that nobody is coming.

734
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,500
that nobody is commanding Ravan for not forcibly.

735
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,000
I know we shouldn't come here.

736
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,680
I know we shouldn't come to somebody for that.

737
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,480
What are we here there for?

738
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,320
Yeah, but in terms of villains, right?

739
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,040
right? Yeah. I mean, we expect villains to be villainous. Yeah. This is a guy that's like if you don't come to

740
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:24,800
Yeah.

741

I mean.

742
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,600
I just like if you don't come to me willingly, I will not touch you.

743
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,100
Right.

744
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,560
I will not force you in my house.

745
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,200
I will not force you in my health.

746
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,400
I will not force myself on you.

And he is still not can withstand man

817
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,040
still not convinced seemed like after she went through the trial by

818
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,520
you went through the trial by fire.

819
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,600
I mean, it's almost like...

820
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,800
No, I thought he was convinced.

821
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,000
He then... it was pure...

822
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
He then it was pure pressure.

823
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Later with the washing.

824
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Yeah, because he was convinced.

825
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,720
because he was convinced, it was not that he doubted it, he kind of was like, okay you

826
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,120
all pure and I think he did hug her and then flop.

827
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
and then flowers fell from the heavens or something.

828
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Whoops.

829
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,640

Hey, they want me to attend this meeting so much, they're gonna fly me all the way to New York.

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Why me all the way to New York?

next week

840
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
No, no, no, no, no, the flying chariot's on the gods sent to chariot.

841
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,640
center chair. I don't know, something about flying. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

842
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I'm fine. I found it to be totally cool.

843
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
We'll take the world's first airplane or something.

844
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
We'll take the first.

845
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,720
something. It was like the first actually flew by. I don't think it was on the on a bird. Was there on a bird?

846
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Was there an abourd?

847
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,500
I think was actually a flying thing, or something like that.

848
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
They were in a carpet like Aladdin.

849
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,500
They were in the car.

850
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
No one was like a elaborate structure and a book.

851
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
That's what he came back on.

852
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000

853
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Pushpaka vi manam.

854
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
That was...

855
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,640
That was one of the air-end-day jump-outs also.

856
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,640
And there's a movie, a silent movie.

857
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,240
movie. That was, yeah. But that's what I mean. It was like this thing.

858
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,480
Let's go.

859
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
It wasn't a bird ever.

860
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Yeah.

861
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Right.

862
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I guess what is happening.

863
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I guess what is happening the 14 years were finishing off so they had to find a quick way to get back.

864
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,200
Let's go music

I was gonna put the money on something like that.

965
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
We don't know exactly when she got ready.

966
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,640
actually when she got very soon thereafter which is why it's conceivable that someone could argue that love that

967
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,200
I love that she wasn't pregnant because of her.

968
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,600

00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000

00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,000
This is the Obiz dektori.

982
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I just intended for gin

983
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,660
There's a 22.1 million dollars of this thing.

984
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,800
And people just amazing things to talk about.

985
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
And the Toby is wife.

986
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Is with somebody else?

987
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
She comes back because what do you think I am wrong?

988
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,040
Because what do you think I'm wrong?

989
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,920
I'm like grandma.

990
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,240
To take somebody bad house.

991
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,240
I've just been in a zombie.

992
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,980
he's an risingoire.

993
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,240
You know, it's a zombie.

994
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:50,780
And that hits the.

995
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,280
says, I cannot rule.

996
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,280
I cannot rule.

997
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,800
If my subjects don't respect me.

998
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,320
Right.

999
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,300
And so you'll have to actually that's when he banishes. Sorry. That's when he banishes.

1000
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:52,960
And so you'll have.

1001
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,520

1002
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000

1003
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,040

1005
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,560

1006
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,000
Yeah, great.

Get packing.

1008
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Brother Laksman, my wife's dubious reputation, calf.

1009
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,080
his reputation casts doubt upon my own.

1010
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,080
You must drive see that to the forest in a band.

1011
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,040
to the forest and abandon her there. I cannot have her in my kingdom. I think...

1012
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I think basically as a king he had to sort of do if it's a god.

1013
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
If the common man was doing that to their wife, then why would the king treat his wife any different?

1014
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,560
his wife any differently kind of.

1015
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:33,080
Like I felt he let her go not because he thought she was impure, but big-

1016
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,040
But because he said that to be a king he needs a respect of his subjects right and he can't

1017
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,200
right and he can't be considered well I don't think he'll have a go-to show.

1018
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,200
I felt that he always had this el...

1019
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
He always had this element of doubt.

1020
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I mean, it coupled with, of course, you know, his.

1021
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
of course, you know, his words show that everybody spoke of and, you know, that he kept his word to his...

1022
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,000
he stepped his word to his dad and then his his subject's his kingdom.

1023
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,720
them, but I felt like he always had this stout that she might not be pure.

1024
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
and not be pure.

1025
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I feel too...

1026
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Too bad

1027
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I'm feeling my mistake

1028
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,860

1154
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:40,400
A smile from Kansas

1155
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Longer and wide to be paid

1156
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:40,960
No

1157
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,640
Outside

1158
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,800
Behind the 칩

1159
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:51,060
There may be shy, Daey

1161
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,040

If loud think is insane,

1195
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:41,220
Rahmatahaa is like a bad

01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,000
So fast, mama's rage, mama's good, mama does what?

drama's just, drama's right.

01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Mama's right, Roma is a guiding right for big man.

Yes.

1204
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Hello?

1206
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Please take me back.

1207
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Please, please.

1208
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,160
Please, please, please.

1209
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,840
I'll do anything, please.

1210
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,400
If you're a girlfriend, who has been treated really badly?

1211
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,000
badly by her ex or by her current boyfriend or whatever.

1212
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,000
and she kept saying, no, every day, I'm gonna make sure.

1213
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,800
I'm gonna make sure I cook for him and send him a hot lunch at noon.

1214
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
at noon.

1215
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,500
Aren't you going to turn on me like listen?

1216
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,220
He doesn't like you and talk to you.

1217
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
You've got to move on.

1218
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:24,980
You gotta move on.

1219
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Something's wrong.

1220
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Okay?

1221
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Tita's doing this, pooch.

1222
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,360
언回來ap hari ini

1223
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,120
harga yang saya think

1224
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,740
See, I feel what I was just like, good and bad thing.

1225
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,880
Perbagai kaybrid

1226
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:37,080
There we always want people to be, either all good or bad, I think.

1227
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,600
all good all but I think she's also has got her own issues like she didn't go back with

1228
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,000
Hanuman, she could have saved her.

1229
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,720
She would have saved hundreds and thousands of people from Inkill.

1230
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,840
Monkey is specially.

1231
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,200
Yeah, what about animals?

1232
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,440
Yeah, what about animal rights and then she bleak

1233
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
She prayed for this guy every day. Come on.

1234
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
But also at that point of...

1235
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,000
But also at that point of time it was just that unconditional love, you know, for her it she was like okay.

1236
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,480
She was like okay.

1237
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:00,760
I think this is the part of the female perspective that I disagree with.

1238
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,160
disagree with because it's like then we can say oh yeah because she loved him so she did

1239
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,840
she did, you know, she's like, yeah, but she sure loves someone who doesn't treat her.

1240
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,000
there you know it's like

1241
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:07,640
She's so badly.

1242
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,040
Okay, that's her mistake.

1243
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
That's her mistake.

1244
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,040
Love

1245
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
you

1246
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:28,040
You wanna way not let you

1247
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,000
We both are tired, let's buy, I want it.

1248
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:28,680
We go

1249
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I wanted to forget you and lay the past

1250
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
And lay the past behind, still the magic.

1251
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,560
All the magic of the night I'm out

1252
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,979
The aim is to stay

1253
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
to stay forever in my mind.

1254
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
But God was blue and high above.

1255
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,000
ING IT'S JUST PUSHING!

1256
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:02,020
Technima

1257
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Was singing, mama, where can you be?

1258
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
You'll be

1259
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
You came alive

1260
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,000
I love how it's down, that day is past

1261
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Today is Pound, you've gone away, they're taking...

1262
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,540
They're taking hard on my sin

1263
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Love will come back to me when

1264
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I remember every little thing

1265
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,140
and useless.

1266
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:32,680
To be continued

1267
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:33,080
cz ba-aiento!

1268
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
I'm lonely, every road I walk alone.

1269
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I walk an animal to the moon with you

1270
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
No

1271
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,000
No wonder I'm lonely

1272
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
The sky is blue, the night is cold

1273
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
The night is cold, the moon is new

1274
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
But not

1275
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,000
But love is all and warm one

1276
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,860
I am ing held as harm as my ability.

1277
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Thank you, love a comeback.

1278
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
This guy is blue, not at all

1279
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:39,800
can add calm, with their blue, but not with mhhhh

1280
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,880
But love is on and what I'm waiting

1281
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,040
When you hear this heart of mine is ding

1282
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,360
Dang it!

1283
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:49,140
Love a combat!

1284
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
That's all.

1285
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,480
And when Ram was in the forest he heard these two boys singing.

1286
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,440
singing. You didn't know who they were, but he came up and he was just like, who are they?

1287
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,040
Who are you? And that's when he finally...

1288
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,400
And that's when he finds out that Sitas de Andoza his children.

1289
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,000
children. My sons. Father. Return to ice.

1290
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,160
return to Ayodhya Palace to rule with me for eternity.

1291
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
But then he wants to take Lavan Koshabakh

1292
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,160
But then...

1293
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
But he still hasn't no more things for back.

1294
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,360
But he's the...

1295
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
See you tomorrow. Well, yes.

1296
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,760
Well, yes, of course, Sita.

1297
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,040
All Sita has to do...

1298
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Sita has to do is prove her purity again.

1299
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Another trial by FAT.

1300
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,040
the trial by fire perhaps or we could try trial by water you know

1301
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:47,000
water you know see if she sinks or floats. If she sinks she's

1302
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:51,000
things, she is pure. If she floats, no way. If she floats,

1303
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,480
If she floats, she's pure, if she's seeing the he has to prove.

1304
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,640
through superiority when I think I should know what nuestras so miracle is.

1305
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,500
Whatever she says, I shall prove my purity to you.

1306
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:02,300
Whatever.

1307
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,000
If I have always been true to Rama, if I have never thought of another...

1308
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,720
Never thought of another man, if I am completely pure in body and soul.

1309
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:13,000
and so then may mother earth take me back.

1310
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Take me back into home.

1311
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

1312
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1313
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Fallin' for nobody else but you

1314
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:21,000
you caught my eye and I got up

1315
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
And I got a feeling I'm falling

1316
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,840
Show me the ring and I

1317
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
You're not your bride-room.

1318
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I used to pass.

1319
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
If you travel, think all we can do makes...

1320
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,000
You may go now, now, now but you may go over you.

1321
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I love all you

1322
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I miss the fallen stands

1323
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,400
Fallen for nobody and but you

1324
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:21,000
아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아 아, 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아 아

oh honey

1326
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Oh honey, I never felt this way

1327
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,000
It's funny, it's so funny.

1328
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:53,000
So funny, me taking it the way, don't know.

1329
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Don't know if I'm sure

1330
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
But they feel good

1331
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I feel good, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, but I...

1332
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,480
But I gotta find it feeling that I'm falling

1333
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:04,980
Fallin' for nobody

1334
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
For nobody else but you

1335
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
And you know it too

1336
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,800
You know it too, you call my eyes

1337
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,960
Baby that I'd love, I'd gotta...

1338
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,760
I've got a funny feeling that I'm falling

1339
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,840
You'll be the ring and a boy

1340
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,000
And oh boy, I'll take it from you.

1341
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,060
I used to tell a single I'll wait and do

1342
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,600
눈 말고나

1343
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,100
나와 못해 가고

1344
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I'm not over you.

1345
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I'll miss the past and bye.

1346
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Don't leave me now, I thought I'd be the nappa that's...

1347
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,000
And I'm gonna burn and I'm gonna fall and fall and I'm gonna die out of you.

1348
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I love you

1349
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,840
那就四哥

1350
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,040
不會去

1351
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:55,280
So we finished our dish.

1352
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,260
With a No-Man

1353
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:56,540
Happy Uralla

1354
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
And then you are haunted.

1355
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Thank you for the home.

1356
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
You and the dog are gone.

1357
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
The night was made up

1358
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Down the world has the way, take your happiness.

1359
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,580
E da maior你說

1360
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,000
The moon is open and I found

1361
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I found you with a break on film, you and a song.

1362
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,560
Run the door, ha, run

1363
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:09,340
But the melody leaves

1364
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:29,220
當队相逢 beacon whom l being used for

1365
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Thank you for helping us all you might.

1366
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1367
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I know, I know, I know, I know, I break up now.

1368
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,000
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A

1369
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,300

1370
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,760

1371
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:22,580

1372
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
We'll go.
